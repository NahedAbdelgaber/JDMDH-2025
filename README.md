ðŸ“– Overview

Socioeconomic Status (SES) is a multi-faceted construct involving education, income, health, and cultural factors. While prior NLP approaches focus mainly on classification, this work introduces an interpretable profiling system that goes beyond prediction to explain why a narrative is associated with a given SES group.

Key contributions:
	â€¢	Thematic Segmentation: Sentence-level mapping into 9 core social/psychological themes.
	â€¢	Topic Modeling: Theme-specific BERTopic with dimensionality reduction and filtering.
	â€¢	Profiling System: Transformer-based similarity scoring to generate SES profiles.
	â€¢	Interpretability Layer: Theme-topic visualizations + alignment with social science theories.
